- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time updates pushed to dashboards without polling
- **Session Management**: Smart session tracking with automatic timeouts and warnings
- **Location History**: Maintains trail of locations for analysis and route reconstruction

### 2. **Advanced Analytics Engine**
- **Performance Metrics**: Distance traveled, locations visited, active time, efficiency scores
- **Team Analytics**: Team-wide performance overview and comparisons
- **Route Analysis**: Speed analysis, route optimization suggestions, coverage area calculation
- **Real-time Insights**: Live dashboard data with performance indicators

### 3. **Enhanced API Endpoints**

#### Location Tracking
- `POST /api/location/update` - Update live location with enhanced data
- `GET /api/location/live/{mr_id}` - Get current live location status
- `GET /api/location/trail/{mr_id}` - Get location trail for analysis

#### Analytics & Insights
- `GET /api/analytics/{mr_id}` - Comprehensive MR analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/team/overview` - Team-wide performance metrics
- `GET /api/dashboard/overview` - Real-time dashboard data
- `GET /api/dashboard/live-map` - Live map data for all MRs
- `GET /api/dashboard/alerts` - System alerts and notifications
- `GET /api/dashboard/performance-metrics` - Detailed performance analysis

#### Real-Time Communication
- `WebSocket /ws/{mr_id}` - Live location updates and notifications

### 4. **Smart Session Management**
- **Enhanced Session Tracking**: Tracks active sessions with location locking
- **Performance Analytics**: Calculates efficiency scores, coverage areas, and activity patterns
- **Location History**: Maintains detailed trail for route analysis
- **Real-time Status**: Live status updates for all MRs
