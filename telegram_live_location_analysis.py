"""

# TELEGRAM LIVE LOCATION CAPABILITIES:

## 1. LIVE LOCATION SHARING (Built-in Feature)
"""
Telegram supports "Live Location" sharing where users can:
- Share live location for 15 minutes, 1 hour, or 8 hours
- Location updates automatically every few seconds
- Other users in chat see live movement on map
- Works while Telegram app is in background (limited)
"""

## 2. LIMITATIONS FOR BUSINESS USE:
"""
❌ Maximum 8 hours continuous sharing
❌ User must manually start live location sharing
❌ No automatic daily tracking
❌ Limited background operation (depends on OS)
❌ User can stop sharing anytime
❌ No enterprise-grade tracking controls
"""

## 3. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
"""
❌ iOS: Very limited background location (10-15 minutes max)
❌ Android: Better background support but still limited
❌ Battery optimization kills background location
❌ Users can disable background app refresh
❌ No guaranteed continuous tracking
"""

## 4. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR MR TRACKING:
"""
✅ Good for: Session-based tracking (doctor visits)
✅ Good for: Manual check-ins at locations  
✅ Good for: Short-duration live tracking (1-8 hours)
❌ Bad for: Full-day automatic tracking
❌ Bad for: Continuous background monitoring
❌ Bad for: Enterprise field force management
