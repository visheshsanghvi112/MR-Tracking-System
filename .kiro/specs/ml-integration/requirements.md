# ML Integration Requirements for MR Bot

## Introduction

This document outlines the strategic integration of Machine Learning capabilities into the MR Bot system. After analyzing the current codebase, we've identified that while the bot has excellent AI integration (Gemini 2.5 Flash), the "ML analytics" are actually statistical analysis. This spec defines where real ML would add significant business value for Medical Representatives and their managers.

## Business Context Analysis

### Current MR Bot Capabilities:
- ✅ Excellent NLP via Gemini AI (real AI)
- ✅ GPS-based session validation
- ✅ Statistical analytics (mislabeled as ML)
- ✅ Basic pattern recognition using rules

### Business Pain Points That ML Can Solve:
1. **Predictive Territory Planning** - Which doctors to visit when
2. **Dynamic Route Optimization** - Real-time route adjustments
3. **Product Recommendation Intelligence** - What to promote to whom
4. **Performance Forecasting** - Predict sales outcomes
5. **Anomaly Detection** - Identify unusual patterns automatically
6. **Behavioral Pattern Learning** - Understand doctor preferences over time

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN historical visit data spans at least 30 days THEN the system SHALL predict visit success probability for each doctor
2. WHEN a doctor hasn't been visited in their optimal frequency window THEN the system SHALL flag them as high-priority
3. WHEN seasonal patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL adjust predictions based on time of year
4. WHEN external factors (holidays, medical conferences) are present THEN the system SHALL incorporate these into predictions
5. IF prediction confidence is below 70% THEN the system SHALL indicate uncertainty and suggest data collection

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Route Optimization Engine

**User Story:** As an MR, I want the system to suggest the optimal sequence of doctor visits based on real-time factors, so that I can maximize my daily productivity and minimize travel time.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I start a field session THEN the system SHALL suggest an optimal route based on doctor availability patterns
2. WHEN traffic conditions change THEN the system SHALL dynamically re-optimize my remaining visits
3. WHEN a doctor cancels or reschedules THEN the system SHALL immediately recalculate the best alternative route
4. WHEN I'm running behind schedule THEN the system SHALL prioritize high-value visits and suggest postponements
5. IF weather conditions affect travel THEN the system SHALL factor this into route planning

### Requirement 3: Personalized Product Recommendation Engine

**User Story:** As an MR, I want AI-powered recommendations on which products to promote to each doctor, so that I can increase my success rate and provide more relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN visiting a doctor THEN the system SHALL recommend top 3 products based on their prescription patterns
2. WHEN a doctor's specialty is known THEN the system SHALL prioritize relevant therapeutic areas
3. WHEN seasonal trends affect prescriptions THEN the system SHALL adjust recommendations accordingly
4. WHEN competitor activity is detected THEN the system SHALL suggest counter-strategies
5. IF a doctor shows resistance to a product THEN the system SHALL learn and avoid future recommendations

### Requirement 4: Advanced Performance Forecasting

**User Story:** As an MR Manager, I want to predict team performance and sales outcomes for the next quarter, so that I can make data-driven decisions and adjust strategies proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN monthly data is available THEN the system SHALL forecast next month's performance with confidence intervals
2. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL adjust forecasts and highlight impact
3. WHEN individual MR patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL predict personal performance trajectories
4. WHEN territory changes occur THEN the system SHALL model the impact on overall performance
5. IF forecast accuracy drops below 80% THEN the system SHALL retrain models automatically

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Anomaly Detection System

**User Story:** As an MR Manager, I want to automatically detect unusual patterns in field activities, so that I can identify problems early and take corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN expense patterns deviate significantly THEN the system SHALL flag potential policy violations
2. WHEN visit patterns become irregular THEN the system SHALL alert about potential performance issues
3. WHEN doctor response patterns change suddenly THEN the system SHALL identify relationship problems
4. WHEN geographic patterns shift unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL highlight territory issues
5. IF multiple anomalies cluster together THEN the system SHALL escalate to management attention

### Requirement 6: Behavioral Learning and Adaptation Engine

**User Story:** As an MR, I want the system to learn from my successful interactions and adapt its recommendations, so that it becomes more personalized and effective over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I have successful visits THEN the system SHALL learn the factors that contributed to success
2. WHEN I follow system recommendations THEN the system SHALL track outcomes and adjust future suggestions
3. WHEN I deviate from recommendations successfully THEN the system SHALL incorporate my approach into its learning
4. WHEN my territory or role changes THEN the system SHALL adapt its models to new contexts
5. IF my performance patterns change THEN the system SHALL detect this and adjust its assistance accordingly
